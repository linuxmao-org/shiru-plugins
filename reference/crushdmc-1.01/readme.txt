CrushDMC by Shiru


Overview

This is a very basic bit crusher plugin that replicated the DMC channel of
Famicom/NES' 2A03 sound chip and the specific distortions that it does
introduce into the sound.

The main intention of the plugin was to have a way to rough estimation on
how a sample could sound like after conversion in FamiTracker or other
software, to find best possible volume and EQ settings before conversion.
It could be used for artistic purposes too.
