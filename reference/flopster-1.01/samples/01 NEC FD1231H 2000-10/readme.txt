To make the recording, the disk drive has been controlled by an Arduino with a
sketch that played all possible sounds. Recorded using Shure C606N microphone
with Behringer U-Phoria UMC204 sound interface. The samples then has been
cleaned up with a little bit of noise reducion in Audacity (no EQ applied),
cut and looped manually in Wavosaur, keeping the starting and stopping clicks,
with a loop inbetween. Volumes between various sounds has been tweaked up a bit
to even them out, because there was huge volume boost at resonant frequencies,
which sounded just unusable for music purposes. Sample seek_34.wav has been
made out of seek_33.wav by shifting pitch one semitone up, because the floppy
drive always get jammed at this exact speed.
